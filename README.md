# Disease-Detection-using-Random-forest
An efficient disease detection model is designed using machine learning algorithm. To help provide people with the diagnoses of the disease, this project presents a user interface that would require the sufferers to input the basic  symptoms they are facing and would inform them about the disease they may be suffering as the output along with the accuracy score in the terminal.

Requirements are available in .txt file and can be installed in a virtual environment.
